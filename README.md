# Simple HTTP Server

This is a reimplementation of the python SimpleHTTPServer module. When run it shares all the files and folders in the directory it is run via an http server.  This is not a good example of a simple http server even though the name claims otherwise. 

This is not a faithful port of the python code it only attempts to mimic the behavior. To this end it uses libraries beyond the stdlib. While it might be a noble goal to only use the std lib that was not a goal of this project.
